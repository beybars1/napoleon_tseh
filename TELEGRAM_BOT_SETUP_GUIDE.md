### Quick Production Setup

Once you have a domain with SSL:

```bash
# Automatic setup
python app/scripts/start_telegram_production.py your-domain.com

# Or via API
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/webhooks/telegram/setup_production" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "your-domain.com"}'
```

### Production Benefits
